    <h2>5 Seconds of Summer - No Shame </h2>
    <p>Angel, with the gun in your hand Pointing my direction, giving me affection Love is fatal Won't you give it a chance? Center of attention
        Don't you ask me any questions Go on and light me like a cigarette Even if it might be something you regret You got me now, now, now Swallow me down, down, down, down
        I only light up when cameras are flashing Never enough and no satisfaction Got no shame I love the way you're screaming my name Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
        Changing my face and calling it fashion Got no shame I love the way you're screaming my name Lay me in the palm of your hand
        I'll give you my permission You'll always be forgiven Go on, replace me When you're craving something sweeter than the words I left in your mouth Go on and spit me out
        I only light up when cameras are flashing Never enough and no satisfaction Got no shame I love the way you're screaming my name Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
        Changing my face and calling it fashion Got no shame I love the way you're screaming my name I love the way you're screaming my name I love the way you're screaming my name
        Go on and light me like a cigarette Even if it might be something you regret You got me now, now, now Swallow me down, down, down, down I only light up when cameras are flashing
        Never enough and no satisfaction Got no shame I love the way you're screaming my name Diggin' my grave to get a reaction Changing my face and calling it fashion
        Got no shame I love the way you're screaming my name I love the way you're screaming my name I love the way you're screaming my name</p>
