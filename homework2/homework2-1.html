<h1>Sacrifice</h1>
<p>I was born in a city. Where the winter nights don't ever sleep. So this life is always with me.
    The ice inside my veins will never bleed. Every time you try to fix me. I know you'll never find that missing piece. When you cry and say you miss me.
    I lie and tell you that I'll never leave. But, I sacrifice. Your love for more of the night. I try to put up a fight. Can't tie me down.
    I don't want to sacrifice. For your love. I try. I don't want to sacrifice. But I love my time.I hold you through the toughest parts. Whеn you feel like it's the end. 'Causе life is still worth living. 'Cause life is still worth living.
    I can break you down and pick you up. And fuck like we are friends. But don't be catching feelings.</p>
   
   
<br> Don't be out here catching feelings. 'Cause. I sacrifice. Your love for more of the night.
    I try to put up a fight. Can't tie me down. I don't want to sacrifice. For your love. I try.
    I don't want to sacrifice. But I love my time.  I don't want to sacrifice. For your love.  I try.
    I don't want to sacrifice.  But I love my time. Oh baby. I hope you know that I tried.Oh baby. I hope you know I love. My time.
    I don't want to sacrifice. I don't want to. I try.I don't want to sacrifice. </p>
    
<br> But I love my time. </p>
